# custom-markov-text-generator

Inspired by:
- Concept: https://towardsdatascience.com/simulating-text-with-markov-chains-in-python-1a27e6d13fc6
- Element count functions: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/count-frequencies-of-all-elements-in-array-in-python

This code takes a text file containing any large string, and generates four-element-wide markov-chain variations based on the corpus. These structures are then chosen at random to generate new sentences, closely mimicing the styles of the original text. Sometimes, it's actually an interesting read.

# Example poetry/lyrics:

## Based on the works of Walt Whitman and Leonard Cohen:

my sweet giving to choose just reply you've done not

the words when the lord you've touched her warbling how to

give it said repent repent repent i will leave it did

your hand now it's all along with opium i'd like i

every eye ay oh the dotted line there in

chairs to know me down on forever i've got time

time the fragrance of her mirror who will help me the

and who am that's why don't count for a gazley

to anyone but the heart to that it's me

into romance i feel that scalpels make a shabby ending reach
